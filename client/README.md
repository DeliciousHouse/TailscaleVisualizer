# Client

The client is a Vite-powered React application written in TypeScript. It renders the network topology and subscribes to WebSocket updates from the server.

## Development
Run the entire app from the project root:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Vite will serve the frontend at `/` and proxy API requests to the backend.

## Next tasks
- [ ] Show device details in a modal dialog
- [ ] Display real-time network statistics in the sidebar
- [ ] Improve the force-directed layout for the graph
- [ ] Add unit tests for components and hooks
